# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
## Name Generator Web Server

## Overview
This project involves building a highly scalable web server in Go that generates random names based on specified criteria. The server will handle thousands of concurrent requests efficiently using Go's concurrency mechanisms.

## Objectives
1. Create a high-performance web server capable of handling numerous concurrent requests
2. Implement efficient name generation functionality
3. Develop a client simulator to test server under load
4. Showcase Go's concurrency and parallelism capabilities
5. Implement detailed monitoring and statistics reporting

## Server Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Accept POST requests with JSON payloads containing:
   - `session_id`: A unique identifier for each client session
   - `letter`: A starting letter for the generated names
   - `num_of_entries`: The number of names to generate

2. Return JSON responses containing:
   - `session_id`: The same session ID that was sent in the request
   - `names`: An array of randomly generated names starting with the specified letter
   - `num_of_entries`: The number of names actually generated

3. Implement logging mechanisms that track:
   - Number of requests processed
   - Memory usage
   - Server capacity (utilization metric)

4. Handle errors gracefully and return appropriate error responses

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance:
   - Handle thousands of concurrent requests
   - Optimize for low latency responses
   - Efficient memory usage

2. Scalability:
   - Scale horizontally if needed
   - Efficient use of Go's goroutines and channels

3. Monitoring:
   - Real-time statistics logging
   - Performance metrics tracking

## Client Simulator Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Generate thousands of simulated clients
2. Send random POST requests to the server with:
   - Random session IDs
   - Random letters
   - Random number of entries requested

2. Track and report:
   - Response times
   - Success/failure rates
   - Throughput (requests per second)

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Performance:
   - Generate high load on the server
   - Simulate realistic user behavior
   - Adjustable concurrency levels

## Technical Architecture

### Server Components
1. HTTP Server:
   - RESTful API endpoint for name generation
   - JSON request/response handling
   - Concurrency management

2. Name Generator:
   - Efficient name generation algorithm
   - Parallelized generation for multiple names

3. Statistics Module:
   - Request counter
   - Memory usage tracker
   - Server capacity calculator

### Client Simulator Components
1. Request Generator:
   - Random request parameter generation
   - Concurrent request dispatching

2. Performance Monitor:
   - Response timing
   - Success/failure tracking
   - Statistical analysis

2. Enhance name generator with concurrency
3. Add comprehensive statistics tracking
4. Develop basic client simulator

### Phase 3: Optimization & Testing
1. Optimize server for maximum concurrency
2. Enhance client simulator for high-volume testing
3. Implement advanced statistics and monitoring
4. Performance testing and tuning

### Phase 4: Refinement
1. Add error handling and edge cases
2. Improve code organization and documentation
3. Final performance optimization
4. Complete testing suite

### Phase 5: UI Implementation
1. Design and implement statistics UI using HTMX and HTML
2. Add real-time updates for server statistics
3. Create a visually appealing and intuitive dashboard
4. Implement server status indicator (online/offline)
5. Optimize UI for different screen sizes

## Statistics UI Implementation Plan

### UI Overview
The Statistics UI provides a real-time dashboard for monitoring server performance and statistics. It shows key metrics including request counts, response times, server load, and resource usage.

### UI Features
1. **Real-time Updates**: Statistics refresh automatically every 2 seconds
2. **Server Status Indicator**: Visual indicator showing whether the server is online/offline
3. **Responsive Design**: Dashboard works on different screen sizes
4. **Organized Metric Display**: Metrics organized in cards by category:
   - Server Overview
   - Request Statistics
   - Server Capacity
   - Response Time Metrics
   - Memory & CPU Usage

### Technical Implementation
1. **Frontend Technologies**:
   - HTMX for seamless updates without full page reloads
   - HTML/CSS for layout and styling
   - Minimal JavaScript for server status checking

2. **Backend Integration**:
   - Endpoint `/stats` serves the HTML dashboard
   - Endpoint `/stats/data` provides real-time stats data for HTMX updates
   - Uses Go HTML templates for rendering

3. **Data Flow**:
   - Main page loads with initial statistics
   - HTMX makes periodic requests to `/stats/data` to update statistics
   - Separate JavaScript monitors server status

### UI Components
1. **Header Section**: Title and subtitle
2. **Server Status Indicator**: Color-coded online/offline status
3. **Stats Dashboard**: Grid layout with individual metric cards
4. **Response Time Section**: Detailed visualization of response time percentiles

### Future Enhancements
1. Add graphical charts for historical data
2. Implement user-configurable refresh rates
3. Add dark mode support
4. Create exportable reports

## Success Metrics
1. Server can handle at least 10,000 concurrent requests
2. Response time under 100ms for 99% of requests
3. Memory usage remains stable under load
4. Clean shutdown with no resource leaks

## Technologies
- Go (latest version)
- Standard library only (no external dependencies)
- Heavy use of Go concurrency primitives:
  - Goroutines
  - Channels
  - Sync package
  - Context package
